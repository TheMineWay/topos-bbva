# 📂 Architecture

In this project I decided to follow the *features* pattern. This means that there are some folders (`common` and `features`) that are organized by feature. Each feature contains common folders (`components`, `hooks`, `utils`, etc.) that are specific to that feature.

This is something I started doing as a result of working on [NestFlux](https://github.com/TheMineWay/NestFlux). I have documentation about this pattern [here](https://themineway.github.io/NestFlux/docs/nestflux/architecture/features).
