# 🖥️ Technologies

Explanation of what I decided to use and why.

## Pnpm

It is my favorite package manager. It is fast and it can be adapted to projects easily (for example: monorepos).

## React

I am simply very used to working with React (the same result would be achieved if I used another one). In my opinion it integrates better with TS than other libraries.

## TypeScript

I love using TS as it gives me the power of JS (my main language) and the safety of static typing. It improves my developer experience and acts as a first testing layer.

## Vite

It allows me to easily setup a React project and has great performance. Also, it integrates very well with my testing library (no spoilers yet about tests).

## Zod

I use it to parse locally stored data. It is very easy to use and has great TS integration. Also, it can be integrated with my forms library.

## React Hook Form

It simply handles forms for me so I don't need to reinvent the wheel.

## Mantine UI

It is my favorite UI library. Maybe it is too big for this project, but I trust the tree-shaking process to reduce the bundle size.

## Vitest (for unit and component testing)

It integrates with Vite (as you might expect) and Playwright (something I discovered while developing this project). It is very easy to use and has great performance.
Also, I love the UI mode.

## Playwright (for e2e testing)

It gives me a great dev experience and is very easy to use. Also, it has great documentation.
It also has a UI mode that allows me to interact and see tests.
